This is a model of a midbrain dopamine neuron presented in the paper

Tarfa RA, Evans RC, Khaliq ZM (2017) Enhanced sensitivity to
hyperpolarizing inhibition in mesoaccumbal relative to nigrostriatal
dopamine neuron subpopulations. J Neurosci

This model was contributed by Dr R Evans and requires the GENESIS
simulator which is freely available from:
http://genesis-sim.org/

To run simulations as seen in figure 11, run "RunCell.g" from the
genesis simulation environment.

Default settings are:

An A-type potassium channel with a slow inactivation time constant
(200ms), which can be changed in the file
DACell/channels/Kaf.g

The other default settings which are altered in the paper are the Ih
gmax = 0.5 S/m^2 and the T-type Ca channel permeability = 1e-7 cm/s
(both in globals.g).

Together these default settings make a 'VTA-like' midbrain dopamine neuron. 

When changing inactivation time constant for current clamp
simulations, the Gmax (in DAcell/globals.g) for the Kaf channel was
adjusted to make the peak currents similar in a single compartment
voltage clamp simulation.

The tau and gmax correspondance is:
tau=200ms, gmax= 24.5 S/m^s
tau=150ms, gmax= 24.5 S/m^s
tau=100ms, gmax= 25 S/m^s
tau=50ms, gmax= 27.5 S/m^s
tau=25ms, gmax= 32 S/m^s

Again, the tau is changed in the channel file (Kaf.g) and the gmax is
changed in the globals file (globals.g)

GABA stimulation simulations can be run by un-commenting
"include DAstims/GABAstim.g" in RunCell.g
